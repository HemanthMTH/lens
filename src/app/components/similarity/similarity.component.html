  <p class="lead">Calculating the resemblance between a pair of textual documents is a frequent undertaking in natural
    language
    processing, featuring numerous real-world uses (e.g., order search engine outcomes or suggest related material to
    users). By comparing privacy policies we can explore which devices have similar privacy policies, or outlier devices
    with privacy policies that are significantly different from others of the same type.</p>

  <p class="lead">Heat Map shown below is a graphical representation of data that uses colors to visualize values of a
    matrix. In the
    context of policy text analysis of several manufacturers, a heatmap can be used to represent the similarities in
    their policies. The matrix would contain pairwise similarity scores between the policies of each manufacturer. By
    visualizing this matrix as a heatmap, we can quickly identify patterns and similarities between the policies of
    different manufacturers. The color scheme used in the heatmap can be customized to highlight areas of high and low
    similarity. Overall, the heatmap provides an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way to analyze and compare
    the policy texts of different manufacturers.

    The table provides a comprehensive list of all the URLs that have been loaded dynamically, making it easy to access

    analyze the data. By using this table as a reference, it becomes possible to quickly identify and locate specific
    URLs that are of interest, allowing for more targeted analysis and visualization.</p>

  <!-- <p class="lead">To implement filtering of manufacturers list and compare their policy text based on the selected
    range, We created a form with a range input that allows the user to select a range of values. The selected range is
    then used to compare the similarity of their policy text.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">The filtering process involves selecting minimum and maximum indexes of the list in the below form.
    This form checks the validity of the values of minimum and maximum based on certain conditions. The condition checks
    if minimum and maximum are present and if minimum is greater than maximum . Additionally, it also checks if the
    difference between maximum and minimum is greater than 30, or if minimum is equal to maximum . If any of these
    conditions are met, the validation will fail and disable the submit button.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">After filtering the manufacturers list, a heat map is rendered to display the results. The heat map
    shows the level of similarity of each manufacturer based on their policy text. The heat map provides a visual
    representation of the manufacturers' similarity status, making it easy for users to identify the compliant and
    non-compliant manufacturers.

  </p>
  <p class="lead">Overall, this approach provides a simple and effective way to filter and compare the policies of
    different manufacturers based on a selected range, enabling users to make informed decisions based on their specific
    needs and requirements.

      Select multiple websites from the below dropdown list to compare their privacy policy text similarity using a
      heatmap chart. The chart
      displays the websites on both axes, and the color intensity represents the similarity score between them. A higher
      similarity score indicates a closer relationship between the privacy policies of the websites. You can select or
      deselect websites to update
      the heatmap dynamically. You will see the chart once you select at least two items form the dropdown list.

    Word embeddings are characterized by extremely high dimensions, which makes visualizing their distribution within
    the embedding space unattainable. To address this issue, we employed the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    technique to decrease the dimensionality of the word embeddings, enabling us to visualize them within a
    two-dimensional space.The chart below gave similar indications that there were three
    groups: one with an average similarity score of 0 to 92% with
    other policies, the second with an average score greater than
    92% and less than 97%, and the third group whose average
    similarity was more significant than others, i.e., greater than
    97% on average.

  <p class="lead">The following chart presents a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of text
    embeddings, specifically derived
    from the privacy policy text of various websites. The purpose of this visual representation is to provide a
    high-level understanding of how similar or dissimilar these policies are to each other, based on their content.</p>
  <p class="lead">
    Every point on this chart represents a unique website's privacy policy. The closeness of these points to one another
    indicates similarity in their privacy policies. In contrast, points that are further apart have more dissimilar
    policy text, suggesting a divergence in their data privacy practices.</p>
