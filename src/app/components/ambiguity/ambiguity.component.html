  <h2 class="fw-bold text-center">Ambiguity</h2>
  <p class="lead">In our research, eight metrics represented
    the policies regarding key information. To classify policies based on these metrics, we used a supervised learning
    algorithm known as the random forest classifier. Supervised learning is a reliable approach for classification
    tasks but requires a significant portion of the dataset to be
    labeled. Therefore, we partially annotated 100 policies in our
    dataset, which was sufficient for the random forest classifier
    to work well for our dataset.

  <p class="lead">Our research concentrated on how ambiguity affects the effectiveness of classification methods.We found that these
    algorithms were less accurate for highly nebulous programs, as they have less well-defined conditions and
    guidelines. Our results highlighted the importance of policy nebulosity as a factor affecting classification models'
    performance, suggesting further research is needed to improve algorithms that can handle nebulous programs.</p>
