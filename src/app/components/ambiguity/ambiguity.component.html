  <!-- <p class="lead text-danger">In our research, eight metrics represented
    the policies regarding key information. To classify policies based on these metrics, we used a supervised learning
    algorithm known as the random forest classifier. Supervised learning is a reliable approach for classification
    tasks but requires a significant portion of the dataset to be
    labeled. Therefore, we partially annotated 100 policies in our
    dataset, which was sufficient for the random forest classifier
    to work well for our dataset.

  <p class="lead text-danger">Our research concentrated on how ambiguity affects the effectiveness of classification
    methods.We
    found that these
    algorithms were less accurate for highly nebulous programs, as they have less well-defined conditions and
    guidelines. Our results highlighted the importance of policy nebulosity as a factor affecting classification models'
    performance, suggesting further research is needed to improve algorithms that can handle nebulous programs.</p>

  <p class="lead text-danger">This study utilized conventional methods to assess policy document similarity, revealing
    that 97% of
    policies are
    similar with minimal metric variation. A small portion of outliers (3%) prompted the development of new metrics to
    evaluate ambiguity in policies are shown below in the grid.</p> -->

            by people can be determined using the coherence score
            in topic modeling. In simplest terms, a coherence score is like a 'makes sense' score for a piece of
            text. It tells us how well the different parts of the text fit together. If the ideas in the text
            smoothly flow from one to another and everything seems related, the text has high coherence. But if the
            text jumps around from one idea to another without clear connections, it has low coherence. It's a way
            for computers to grade the quality of a text, similar to how a teacher might grade an essay."

          2. Entropy
          <i class="fas fa-info-circle" ngbTooltip="A statistical quantity called the entropy of a
            language gauges, in a sense, how much information is
            generated on average for each letter in a text in that
            language. In simpler terms, it defines the uncertainty or
            disorder in a text document. The uncertainty of the meaning of textual terms is expressed
            in two ways: the meaning we get from it and the context
            in which it is utilized.
            Entropy was computed by iterating over the policy document

          policy document is to provide consumers with relevant
          and crucial information about how their data is used
          and if they have control over that data. This knowledge
          is conveyed using specialized technical jargon which
          can sometimes be hard to comprehend based on the
          context. The bounds of certain learning categories are
          being pushed by these unusual words, and the words
          around them offer crucial context. People usually don’t
          encounter low-frequency words which makes it hard for
          them to understand and comprehend these works which
          leads to the argument that unique words require unique
          instruction, because informational texts integrate
          vocabulary and concepts, it is hard to completely comprehend
          the material without a solid understanding of
          the unique, low-frequency phrases. It is hard to skip
          through complicated jargon while still having a general
          understanding of the subject matter; therefore, individuals
          must have expert-level knowledge of these words
          in order to grasp the content. The frequency of unique words is a measure of how many different words
          are used in a piece of text.
          
          This measure can tell you a lot about a piece of text. For instance, a text with many unique words might
          have a rich vocabulary or cover a wide range of topics. A text with few unique words might be more

          <i class="fas fa-info-circle" ngbTooltip="Readability refers to how simple or it is to read something. The readability of a text is determined by
          how it is presented and the context in which words and phrases in the document are delivered. Additional
          elements that influence reading are
          sentence length, sentence structure, and syllable count
          per word. These aspects work together to determine how
          well your writing will be comprehended. Readability
          is crucial since it determines how well a reader understands
          a piece of text. Policies should be easy to read
          because they describe the policies and practices of the
          businesses regarding the data that is gathered from consumers.
          There are many readability tests which
          have been devised by linguists and are based on different
          factors like the vocabulary used, the syntax and the sentence
          structure. For our study, we used Flesch-Kincaid

          lengthy and time-consuming. Reading time is calculated
          using an individual’s typical reading pace (roughly 238
          WPM). We used an approach that involved counting
          all of the words in the document and dividing the total
          by 238 to produce a decimal number. The minute is
          the first digit of the decimal number. Then we multiply
          the second half (the decimal points) by 0.60, these are
          the seconds. We round up to get a whole number that

          used frequently. For instance, it may be difficult to understand general terms like 'commonly' or

          connecting words are used to join clauses or
          phrases. They are crucial for the creation of coherent
          sentences. However, overusing connectives makes a text
          more complicated. The following is an excerpt from a
          Policy that might be interesting to observe: 'Like most
          online service providers, we collect information that online
          services, portable devices, and cloud services typically
          make available, including the internet browser,
          Source IP, unique device identifiers, language choice, referring
          site, the date and time of access, operating system,
          and mobile network information'. Three times in this
          phrase, the conjunction 'and' has been used to connect
          different clauses and reading this sentence is challenging.
          Research related to textual information suggests
          counting the number of connective terms to assess the
          text’s quality in software requirements." placement="right"></i>

          Each tokenized text which was produced with the
          help of NLP is compared to a parse tree to ensure that the

  <p class="lead">We found that almost all smart-connected car policies were classified as very ambiguous, indicating a
    need for clearer information. Our analysis showed EU privacy policies to be less ambiguous than those in the US and
    China, likely due to stricter data privacy laws like GDPR. We categorized policies into three ambiguity levels:
    not-ambiguous, somewhat-ambiguous, and very-ambiguous. The EU had the highest percentage of not-ambiguous policies
    (65.8%), while China had the lowest (54.3%). The US had the most somewhat-ambiguous policies (27.5%), with the EU
    having the least (12.5%). In the very-ambiguous category, China had the highest percentage (23.9%), and the US had
