  <h2 class="fw-bold text-center">Keyword Analysis</h2>
  <p class="lead">In this section, we explore keyword analysis performed in our study to better understand the privacy
    policies of different smart devices. By examining keyword frequency within distinct groups across all devices, we
    identified trends and patterns that offer valuable insights into the current state of privacy policies in the smart
    device sector. We conducted a keyword analysis of 462 smart device privacy policies
    and grouped the keywords into ten distinct groups to identify trends and patterns as shown in the grid below. </p>

  </div>
  <p class="lead"> We then analyzed the frequency of
    these groups across all the devices studied to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of privacy
    policies in the smart device industry. Then extracted relevant keywords from each policy and obtained the Maximum,
    Minimum, and Average values for each group across all devices studied, refer chart for better illustration. This
    allowed them to gain valuable insights
    into the privacy practices of different smart devices.</p>

  <p class="lead">Overall, it can be observed that policies that mention devices provide a higher keyword count, which
    helps users navigate the information repeatedly, contributing to better controls
    for users, privacy regulations, and transparency</p>
