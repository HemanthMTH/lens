        Our dataset presents an interesting exploration into the privacy policies of various
        websites, with a particular focus on the types of devices they cater to. The device categories range from
        general to miscellaneous, representing the diversity in the digital ecosystem.

        Interestingly, a significant number of websites do not explicitly mention devices in their privacy policies.
        This highlights an area of potential improvement, as transparency about device-specific data collection and use
        is an essential aspect of user trust and regulatory compliance.

        The dataset also captures various other privacy-related keywords, including 'First Party Collection', 'Third
        Party Collection', 'OPT-OUT', 'User Choice', and more.
