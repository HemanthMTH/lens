        The PrivacyLens dataset is continuously evolving. As of now, it contains
        1200 privacy policies extracted for 5198 smart devices from 32
        categories. The following graph shows the distribution of privacy
        policies based on different categories of smart devices.

        PrivacyLens collects and analyzes privacy policies from smart devices
        from manufacturers all around the world. This following map provides a
        geographical representation of privacy policies of different
        manufacturers across the globe. The colors represent the proportion of
        such policies for each country, expressed as a percentage of the total
        count. Hover over a country to see the specific percentage. For
        instance, a higher percentage indicates that a greater proportion of
        policies in that country explicitly mention smart devices.
