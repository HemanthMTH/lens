            in topic modeling. In simplest terms, a coherence score is like a 'makes sense' score for a piece of
            text. It tells us how well the different parts of the text fit together. If the ideas in the text
            smoothly flow from one to another and everything seems related, the text has high coherence. But if the
            text jumps around from one idea to another without clear connections, it has low coherence. It's a way
            for computers to grade the quality of a text, similar to how a teacher might grade an essay."

            disorder in a text document. The uncertainty of the meaning of textual terms is expressed
            in two ways: the meaning we get from it and the context
            in which it is utilized.

          policy document is to provide consumers with relevant
          and crucial information about how their data is used

          is conveyed using specialized technical jargon which
          can sometimes be hard to comprehend based on the
          context. The bounds of certain learning categories are
          being pushed by these unusual words, and the words
          around them offer crucial context. People usually don’t
          encounter low-frequency words which makes it hard for
          them to understand and comprehend these works which
          leads to the argument that unique words require unique
          instruction, because informational texts integrate
          vocabulary and concepts, it is hard to completely comprehend
          the material without a solid understanding of
          the unique, low-frequency phrases. It is hard to skip
          through complicated jargon while still having a general
          understanding of the subject matter; therefore, individuals
          must have expert-level knowledge of these words
          in order to grasp the content. The frequency of unique words is a measure of how many different words
          are used in a piece of text.
          
          This measure can tell you a lot about a piece of text. For instance, a text with many unique words might
          have a rich vocabulary or cover a wide range of topics. A text with few unique words might be more
          repetitive or focused on a single topic."

          how it is presented and the context in which words and phrases in the document are delivered. Additional
          elements that influence reading are
          sentence length, sentence structure, and syllable count
          per word. These aspects work together to determine how
          well your writing will be comprehended. Readability
          is crucial since it determines how well a reader understands
          a piece of text. Policies should be easy to read
          because they describe the policies and practices of the
          businesses regarding the data that is gathered from consumers.
          There are many readability tests which
          have been devised by linguists and are based on different
          factors like the vocabulary used, the syntax and the sentence
          structure. For our study, we used Flesch-Kincaid

          lengthy and time-consuming. Reading time is calculated
          using an individual’s typical reading pace (roughly 238
          WPM). We used an approach that involved counting
          all of the words in the document and dividing the total
          by 238 to produce a decimal number. The minute is
          the first digit of the decimal number. Then we multiply
          the second half (the decimal points) by 0.60, these are
          the seconds. We round up to get a whole number that

          more complicated. The following is an excerpt from a
          Policy that might be interesting to observe: 'Like most
          online service providers, we collect information that online
          services, portable devices, and cloud services typically

          Source IP, unique device identifiers, language choice, referring
          site, the date and time of access, operating system,
          and mobile network information'. Three times in this
          phrase, the conjunction 'and' has been used to connect
          different clauses and reading this sentence is challenging.
          Research related to textual information suggests
          counting the number of connective terms to assess the
