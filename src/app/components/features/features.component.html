            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Coherence Score</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                How easily the topics are understood
                by people can be determined using the coherence score
                in topic modeling. In simplest terms, a coherence score is like a "makes sense" score for a piece of
                text. It tells us how well the different parts of the text fit together. If the ideas in the text
                smoothly flow from one to another and everything seems related, the text has high coherence. But if the
                text jumps around from one idea to another without clear connections, it has low coherence. It's a way
                for computers to grade the quality of a text, similar to how a teacher might grade an essay.

            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Entropy</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                A statistical quantity called the entropy of a
                language gauges, in a sense, how much information is
                generated on average for each letter in a text in that
                language. In simpler terms, it defines the uncertainty or
                disorder in a text document. The uncertainty of the meaning of textual terms is expressed
                in two ways: the meaning we get from it and the context
                in which it is utilized.
                Entropy was computed by iterating over the policy document
                characters and noting the frequency of occurrence
                of each one.

            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Frequency of Unique Words</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                The goal of the privacy
                policy document is to provide consumers with relevant
                and crucial information about how their data is used
                and if they have control over that data. This knowledge
                is conveyed using specialized technical jargon which
                can sometimes be hard to comprehend based on the
                context. The bounds of certain learning categories are
                being pushed by these unusual words, and the words
                around them offer crucial context. People usually don’t
                encounter low-frequency words which makes it hard for
                them to understand and comprehend these works which
                leads to the argument that unique words require unique
                instruction, because informational texts integrate
                vocabulary and concepts, it is hard to completely comprehend
                the material without a solid understanding of
                the unique, low-frequency phrases. It is hard to skip
                through complicated jargon while still having a general
                understanding of the subject matter; therefore, individuals
                must have expert-level knowledge of these words
                in order to grasp the content. The frequency of unique words is a measure of how many different words
                are used in a piece of text.
                For example, if you write a story and use the word "cat" 10 times, "dog" 5 times, and "bird" 1 time, you
                have 3 unique words: "cat", "dog", and "bird". The frequency of each unique word is 10, 5, and 1,
                respectively.
                This measure can tell you a lot about a piece of text. For instance, a text with many unique words might
                have a rich vocabulary or cover a wide range of topics. A text with few unique words might be more
                repetitive or focused on a single topic.

            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Reading Level</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                Readability refers to how simple or it is to read something. The readability of a text is determined by
                how it is presented and the context in which words and phrases in the document are delivered. Additional
                elements that influence reading are
                sentence length, sentence structure, and syllable count
                per word. These aspects work together to determine how
                well your writing will be comprehended. Readability
                is crucial since it determines how well a reader understands
                a piece of text. Policies should be easy to read
                because they describe the policies and practices of the
                businesses regarding the data that is gathered from consumers.
                There are many readability tests which
                have been devised by linguists and are based on different
                factors like the vocabulary used, the syntax and the sentence
                structure. For our study, we used Flesch-Kincaid
                Grade Level which displays the score in terms of a
                U.S. grade level.

            <p class="card-text lead">
                Privacy policies
                are hard to read, rarely read, and don’t help customers
                make informed decisions due to the fact that they are very
                lengthy and time-consuming. Reading time is calculated
                using an individual’s typical reading pace (roughly 238
                WPM). We used an approach that involved counting
                all of the words in the document and dividing the total
                by 238 to produce a decimal number. The minute is
                the first digit of the decimal number. Then we multiply
                the second half (the decimal points) by 0.60, these are
                the seconds. We round up to get a whole number that
                represents the total reading time of the policy.

            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Frequency of Imprecise Words</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                Some terms are naturally imprecise in the English language. Texts may become unclear if such terms are
                used frequently. For instance, it may be difficult to understand general terms like "commonly" or
                "normally," which give an incorrect picture of the service provider’s operations and cause uncertainty
                in determining the statement’s true meaning.

            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Frequency of Connective Words</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                In the English language,
                connecting words are used to join clauses or
                phrases. They are crucial for the creation of coherent
                sentences. However, overusing connectives makes a text
                more complicated. The following is an excerpt from a
                Policy that might be interesting to observe: "Like most
                online service providers, we collect information that online
                services, portable devices, and cloud services typically
                make available, including the internet browser,
                Source IP, unique device identifiers, language choice, referring
                site, the date and time of access, operating system,
                and mobile network information". Three times in this
                phrase, the conjunction "and" has been used to connect
                different clauses and reading this sentence is challenging.
                Research related to textual information suggests
                counting the number of connective terms to assess the
                text’s quality in software requirements.

            <h5 class="card-title lead"><strong>Correct Grammar</strong></h5>
            <p class="card-text lead">
                The integrity of a work depends on
                proper grammar, much as it does on word spelling. Every
                sentence of a policy document went through the framework
                to ensure that the grammar was used correctly.
                Each tokenized text which was produced with the
                help of NLP is compared to a parse tree to ensure that the
                Grammar is valid. We track the proportion of sentences
                with poor grammar in each text relative to the overall
                number of sentences.
